# RotaryPhoneExchangeEmulator
This system simulates a telephone exchange connected to a rotary phone.  It provides the dial tone and ring tone.  When the user dials a number, it plays back an MP3 file stored on the SD card.  A call can also be initiated from an IR remote control.  This causes the phone to ring and when the user picks up, plays the requested sound file.
